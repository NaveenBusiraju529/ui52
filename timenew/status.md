### Modular Approach

#### View Modularization
- **time2.view.xml**: Uses f:Card-wrapped fragments for tiles and calendar with 40/60 grid layout.
- **time3.view.xml**: Uses f:Card-wrapped fragments for tiles and calendar with 40/60 grid layout and consistent grid-like tile structure.
- **time4.view.xml**: Uses f:Card-wrapped fragments for tiles and calendar with 40/60 grid layout and two-column grid layout for tiles.

#### Fragment-Based Components
- **Calendar Component**: `fragments/calendar/TeamCalendar.fragment.xml`
  - Encapsulates the SinglePlanningCalendar.
  - Status legend has been removed from the fragment.
  - Used identically across all three views, wrapped in f:Card for consistent styling.

- **Tile Components (using `sap.f.Card`)**: Located in `fragments/tiles/`
  - Each tile is implemented as a reusable fragment based on `sap.f.Card`.
  - Standardized internal structure (Icon + Title header, action Buttons).
  - Detailed content customized per tile:
    - Timesheet: Single "Entry" action button
    - Reports: Three action buttons for "Activity Report", "Customer Timesheet", and "Home Working Report"
    - Team Management: Tabbed interface (PM/LM) with six actions each for approvals and reports
    - Team & LM: Six action buttons for approvals and various reports
    - Booking: Chart display showing franchise booking values with visualization
    - Project: Six action buttons for approvals and various reports

#### Controller Modularization
- **Base Controllers**: `time2.controller.js`, `time3.controller.js`, `time4.controller.js`.
- **Reusable Modules**: `common/CalendarController.js`, `common/TileActionsController.js`. (No changes in this update).

#### How Components Interact (No changes in this update)
1. View Loading -> Fragments Included
2. Controller Init -> Modules Instantiated
3. Event Delegation -> Base controller delegates to modules
4. Data Sharing -> Models shared

## Components Implemented

### 1. Dashboard Layout
- Responsive grid layout using sap.ui.layout.cssgrid.GridResponsiveLayout.
- Consistent 40/60 split layout across all views.
- Responsive behavior for small, medium, and large screens.

### 2. Navigation Tiles (Refactored to Cards)
- **Technology**: Switched from `sap.m.GenericTile` to `sap.f.Card` for all tiles.
- **Structure**: Standardized card layout:
  - Header: `HBox` with `core:Icon` (30px) and bold `Text` title.
  - Content: `VBox` with action `Button`s (transparent, slim-arrow-right icon).
- **Content Specificity**:
  - Custom action buttons relevant to each tile's purpose
  - BookingTile with chart visualization showing franchise data
  - Team and Project tiles with comprehensive management options
- **Styling**:
    - Sharp rectangular corners enforced via CSS (`border-radius: 0`).
    - Equal height for tiles within the same row via CSS (`equalHeightTile` class and grid `align-items: stretch`).
    - Consistent spacing using standard margin classes.
- **Fragments**: All fragments in `fragments/tiles/` updated with specific content requirements.

### 3. SinglePlanningCalendar Fragment
- **Implementation**: Reusable `TeamCalendar.fragment.xml`.
- **Legend Removed**: The status legend panel has been removed from the fragment and all views.
- **Views**: Day, Work Week, Month views remain.
- **Features**: Appointment selection remains.
- **Styling**: Wrapped in f:Card for consistent appearance with tiles.

### 4. Controller Modules
- `CalendarController.js` and `TileActionsController.js` remain.

## Modular Architecture

### 1. Fragment-Based Components
- **Calendar Fragment**: `TeamCalendar.fragment.xml` (legend removed).
- **Tile Fragments**: Replaced `GenericTile` fragments with `f:Card` based fragments in `fragments/tiles/`.

### 2. Modular Controllers
- Base controllers + Shared modules pattern remains.

### 3. Consistent Patterns
- Fragment loading, event delegation patterns remain.
- Styling classes updated (`equalHeightTile`, `boldFont`).

## Styling Enhancements

### 1. Layout Improvements
- **Grid-Based Layout**: Replaced FlexBox layout with sap.ui.layout.cssgrid.CSSGrid and GridResponsiveLayout for more robust, responsive layouts.
- **Equal Tile Heights**: Implemented CSS using grid `align-items: stretch` and a custom `equalHeightTile` class to ensure tiles in the same row automatically adjust to the same height.
- **Consistent Tile Widths**: Updated time3.view.xml to use consistent width for tiles with proper spacing using grid layout.
- **Responsive Grid Settings**: Added specific layout configurations for small screens that stack content vertically and medium/large screens that maintain the 40/60 split.
- **Legend Removal**: Removed all legend panels for a cleaner, more focused interface.

### 2. Calendar Styling
- **Card-Based Encapsulation**: Calendar is now wrapped in f:Card for consistent styling with tiles.
- **Legend Removed**: Status legend panel removed from all views for consistent, clean appearance.
- **Sharp Corners**: CSS ensures sharp rectangular corners for the calendar and its internal elements (`border-radius: 0`).
- **Full Height Utilization**: Calendar card takes full available height for better space utilization.

### 3. Tile Styling (Now Card Styling)
- **Sharp Rectangular Design**: Applied global CSS (`border-radius: 0 !important;`) to enforce sharp corners on cards, buttons, and other elements, aligning with the target design.
- **Card Structure**: Uses `sap.f.Card` with internal `FlexBox`, `HBox`, `VBox` structure.
- **Consistent Header**: Icon (30px) left of bold title text.
- **Action Buttons**: Standardized `sap.m.Button` usage (transparent, slim-arrow-right icon).
- **Equal Heights**: Ensured via CSS (`equalHeightTile` class) and grid layout properties.
- **Grid-Based Arrangement**: Tiles now arranged using CSSGrid instead of FlexBox for more consistent behavior.
- **Customized Content**: Specific content and action buttons for each tile type based on its purpose.

### 4. Grid-Based UI Improvements
- **Native Grid Support**: Used SAP's grid:CSSGrid component with GridResponsiveLayout for better responsiveness.
- **Consistent Spacing**: Maintained consistent gap (0.5rem) between grid items for clean appearance.
- **Nested Grids**: Implemented nested grids in time4.view to achieve the two-column layout with individual columns.
- **Equal Height Rows**: Grid layout ensures equal heights for elements in the same row.
- **Improved Responsive Behavior**: Added media queries for smaller screens to adjust the grid layout appropriately.

## Recent Updates (June 4, 2024)
