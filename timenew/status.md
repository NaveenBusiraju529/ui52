### Modular Approach

#### View Modularization
- **time2.view.xml**: Uses fragments for tiles and calendar with 20/80 layout
- **time3.view.xml**: Uses fragments for tiles and calendar with 40/60 layout
- **time4.view.xml**: Uses fragments for tiles and calendar with 40/60 layout and two-column tiles

#### Fragment-Based Components
- **Calendar Component**: `fragments/calendar/TeamCalendar.fragment.xml`
  - Encapsulates the entire SinglePlanningCalendar with consistent styling
  - Used identically across all three views
  
- **Tile Components**:
  - `fragments/tiles/TimesheetTile.fragment.xml`: Timesheet entry options
  - `fragments/tiles/ReportsTile.fragment.xml`: Report viewing options
  - `fragments/tiles/TeamTile.fragment.xml`: Team management for PMs
  - `fragments/tiles/LMTile.fragment.xml`: Line manager functions
  - `fragments/tiles/BookingTile.fragment.xml`: Booking management
  - `fragments/tiles/ProjectTile.fragment.xml`: Project management

#### Controller Modularization
- **Base Controllers**:
  - `time2.controller.js`: Base controller for time2 view
  - `time3.controller.js`: Base controller for time3 view
  - `time4.controller.js`: Base controller for time4 view
  
- **Reusable Modules**:
  - `common/CalendarController.js`: Handles all calendar functionality
  - `common/TileActionsController.js`: Handles common tile actions

#### How Components Interact
1. **View Loading**:
   - Each view loads with its corresponding controller
   - Views include fragments for tiles and calendar
   
2. **Controller Initialization**:
   - Base controllers instantiate reusable modules in `onInit()`
   - Example: `this._calendarController = new CalendarController(this);`
   
3. **Event Delegation**:
   - Base controllers delegate events to appropriate modules
   - Example: `onAppointmentSelect: function(oEvent) { this._calendarController.onAppointmentSelect(oEvent); }`
   
4. **Data Sharing**:
   - Models are shared between controllers and fragments
   - Consistent model structure for appointments and calendar data

## Implemented Views

### 1. Timesheet View 2 (time2.view.xml)
- Dashboard layout with a 20/80 split between navigation tiles and calendar
- Fully modularized with reusable fragments for tiles and calendar
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

### 2. Timesheet View 3 (time3.view.xml)
- Dashboard layout with a 40/60 split 
- Separate tiles for Timesheet, Reports, Team, and LM functions
- Fully modularized with reusable fragments for tiles and calendar
- Same responsive behavior for different screen sizes

### 3. Timesheet View 4 (time4.view.xml)
- Dashboard layout with a 40/60 split
- Two-column layout for tiles with 5 different tile types
- Fully modularized with reusable fragments for tiles and calendar
- Same responsive behavior for different screen sizes

## Components Implemented

### 1. Dashboard Layout
- **Structure**: Implemented a responsive dashboard layout with a appropriate split between navigation tiles and the calendar
- **Technology**: Used FlexBox containers for better responsive behavior
- **Responsiveness**: Automatically adjusts to different screen sizes with mobile-specific styling

### 2. Navigation Tiles
- **Tile Fragments**:
  - TimesheetTile: Timesheet entry options
  - ReportsTile: Report viewing options
  - TeamTile: Team management for Project Managers
  - LMTile: Line manager functions
  - BookingTile: Booking management
  - ProjectTile: Project management
  
- **Tile Styling**:
  - Consistent design with title at top and icon in top-right corner
  - Contains specific options as links with proper formatting
  - Sharp rectangular corners with bold blue borders
  - Compact layout with optimized spacing

### 3. SinglePlanningCalendar Fragment
- **Implementation**: Extracted as reusable TeamCalendar fragment
- **Views**: Implemented Day, Work Week, and Month views
- **Features**:
  - Appointment creation and editing
  - Appointment selection
  - View switching
  - Calendar legend for appointment types
- **Actions**: Added buttons for adding, editing, and canceling appointments

### 4. Controller Modules
- **CalendarController**: Reusable module for calendar functionality
  - Appointment creation
  - Appointment editing
  - Appointment deletion
  - View handling
  
- **TileActionsController**: Reusable module for common tile actions
  - Timesheet functions
  - Report functions
  - Team management functions
  - Booking functions
  - Project functions

## Modular Architecture

### 1. Fragment-Based Components
- **Calendar Fragment**: Extracted the SinglePlanningCalendar into a reusable fragment
- **Tile Fragments**: Created separate fragments for each tile type
- **Legend Fragment**: Calendar legend implemented consistently across views

### 2. Modular Controllers
- **Base Controllers**: Each view has its own base controller
- **Shared Modules**: Common functionality extracted into shared modules
- **Dependency Injection**: Controllers pass themselves to modules for context

### 3. Consistent Patterns
- **Fragment Loading**: Consistent approach to loading fragments
- **Event Delegation**: Consistent pattern for delegating events to modules
- **Styling Classes**: Consistent application of styling classes for visual uniformity

## Styling Enhancements

### 1. Layout Improvements
- **Adjusted Proportions**: Different layout proportions for different views
- **Fixed Sizing Issues**: Ensured the calendar takes up appropriate space
- **Overflow Handling**: Prevented content overflow in all calendar views
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented media queries for different screen sizes
- **Consistent Padding**: Applied uniform padding throughout the application for visual consistency

### 2. Calendar Styling
- **Month View Fixes**: Added specific styling for month view to prevent overflow
- **Visual Enhancements**: Replaced rounded corners with sharp rectangular corners
- **Bold Blue Borders**: Added 3px solid #0070b1 borders to all calendar components
- **Consistent Corner Style**: Ensured all calendar elements maintain sharp corners in all states
- **Uniform Padding**: Applied consistent padding to calendar components

### 3. Tile Styling
- **Content Display**: Enhanced tiles with title at top, icon at top-right, and content below
- **Compact Sizing**: Reduced padding and margins for more efficient space usage
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Used proper spacing and typography for clear information hierarchy
- **Text Containment**: Fixed issues with text overflow in tiles
- **Responsive Tiles**: Made tiles adjust their size to fit content properly
- **Sharp Rectangles**: Changed all tile borders from rounded to sharp rectangular corners
- **Bold Blue Borders**: Applied 3px solid #0070b1 borders to all tiles
- **Consistent Spacing**: Implemented uniform padding and margins throughout all tile components

## Next Steps

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Data Integration**: Connect to backend services for real appointment data
2. **User Settings**: Add personalization options for calendar views and preferences
3. **Offline Support**: Implement local storage for offline functionality

### Known Issues
- All previously reported issues have been fixed

## Technical Implementation Details

### CSS Approach
- Used SAPUI5 responsive classes where possible
- Added custom CSS for specific component styling
- Used word-wrap and overflow properties to contain text
- Created custom tile layout with HBox for header and VBox for content
- Established uniform padding and margin system for visual consistency
- Used !important declarations strategically to override default SAPUI5 styling

### Component Structure
- Implemented modular architecture with reusable fragments and controller modules
- Maintained separation of concerns between view, controller, and styling
- Used consistent component patterns across all views
- Leveraged SAPUI5 standard controls with custom enhancements
- Optimized sizing and spacing for better visual appearance

### Routing and Navigation
- Implemented routing for all views (time2, time3, and time4)
- Set time2 as the default view
- Created separate controllers for each view with appropriate event handlers
- Used consistent naming conventions across controllers
